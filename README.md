Week 1: WordNet
---------------

[WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) is a semantic lexicon for the English language that is used extensively by computational linguists and cognitive scientists; for example, it was a key component in IBM's [Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)). WordNet groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets and describes semantic relationships between them. One such relationship is the is-a relationship, which connects a hyponym (more specific synset) to a hypernym (more general synset). For example, a plant organ is a hypernym of carrot and plant organ is a hypernym of plant root.
