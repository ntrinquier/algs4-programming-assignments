algs4-programming-assignments
=============================

To compile the assignments, you will need the .jar files (stdlib.jar and algs4.jar) [provided by Princeton University](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

Week 1: WordNet
---------------

[WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) is a component used to represent relationships between groups of synonyms. With WordNet, one can compute the distance between words or identify an outcast in a set of words, among others things. As the underlying data structure is a graph, some classic graph algorithms are used in the assignment.
For more information see the [assignment specification](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/wordnet.html).
